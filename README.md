# Pilotship Software Factory

The repeatable, model- and harness-agnostic way we ship software at
[Pilotship](https://pilotship.io). Every task in every repo moves through four
beats, **isolate → build → prove → ship**, each backed by a markdown skill in
this repo. It works the same in Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex CLI, with any
model.

Forked from [michaelshimeles/skills](https://github.com/michaelshimeles/skills)
(the skills from the "software factory" walkthrough). Upstream skills stay
vendored and unmodified under their own folders; everything Pilotship-specific
lives under [`pilotship/`](pilotship/).

## Start here

| If you are... | Read |
|---|---|
| A developer joining a factory-enabled repo | [`pilotship/ONBOARDING.md`](pilotship/ONBOARDING.md) |
| Rolling the factory out to a repo | [`pilotship/ROLLOUT_CHECKLIST.md`](pilotship/ROLLOUT_CHECKLIST.md), then run `pilotship/factory-init.sh` |
| Wondering why Greptile, and how to swap it | [`pilotship/REVIEW_BOTS.md`](pilotship/REVIEW_BOTS.md) |
| Logging what broke during the pilot | [`pilotship/PILOT_LOG.md`](pilotship/PILOT_LOG.md) |

### Install into a repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sema-solutions/Software-factory-skills.git ~/Software-factory-skills
cd <your-repo> && git checkout -b chore/software-factory
bash ~/Software-factory-skills/pilotship/factory-init.sh
```

The script installs the seven skills into `.agents/skills/` (canonical, read
by Cursor and Codex) with symlinks into `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code), pins
them in `skills-lock.json`, appends the factory block to `.gitignore`, and
drops in the `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, PR template, and the two database
isolation scripts. It never overwrites an existing file: where one exists it
writes a `*.factory.*` copy beside it for you to merge. Run it again any time
to pick up template changes. `npx skills update` refreshes the skills alone.

### What `pilotship/` contains

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.template.md` | The contract: four beats, multi-agent rules, shared-resource (database/port) rules, Pilotship house rules, a repo-specific section to fill |
| `CLAUDE.template.md` | Thin Claude Code pointer to AGENTS.md |
| `factory-init.sh` | Idempotent installer described above |
| `templates/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | PR body with a mandatory Proof section |
| `templates/gitignore.factory` | Worktree and evidence paths to ignore |
| `templates/scripts/worktree-env.sh` | Gives each worktree its own database and port |
| `templates/scripts/db-guard.sh` | Refuses migrate/seed/reset against the wrong database |
| `templates/github/pr-agent.yml` | Optional open-source reviewer workflow (PR-Agent) |
| `ONBOARDING.md`, `ROLLOUT_CHECKLIST.md`, `REVIEW_BOTS.md`, `PILOT_LOG.md` | Team docs |

### Keeping up with upstream

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/michaelshimeles/skills.git   # once
git fetch upstream && git checkout main && git merge upstream/main
```

Upstream folders (`new-feature/`, `code-structure/`, `evidence-driven-testing/`,
`before-and-after/`, `greploop/`, `greploop-apps/`, `unslop/`, `AGENTS.md`,
`tests/`) are left as upstream ships them so merges stay clean, with one
deliberate exception: `before-and-after/scripts/upload-and-copy.sh` defaults
`IMAGE_ADAPTER` to `gist` instead of the public 0x0.st host (see the comment
there). Re-check that line after every upstream merge. If a skill
needs Pilotship behavior, add a variant under `pilotship/skills/<name>/` rather
than editing the vendored one.

# Upstream skills reference

The rest of this file is upstream's README, kept for reference.

## Available skills

### [before-and-after](before-and-after/SKILL.md)

Captures before/after screenshots of web pages or elements and outputs a PR-ready markdown comparison table. It drives the `@vercel/before-and-after` CLI.

Use it when:

- A PR needs visual proof that a UI change does what it claims
- You want a `| Before | After |` table generated and uploaded in one step
- Comparing two URLs, two existing images, or a mix of both

> Vendored from [vercel-labs/before-and-after](https://github.com/vercel-labs/before-and-after) (PolyForm Shield 1.0.0, license included in the folder). Install the CLI with `npm i -g @vercel/before-and-after agent-browser`.

### [code-structure](code-structure/SKILL.md)

Service layer architecture guidance. Enforces a two-layer separation where **actions** orchestrate domain rules (the "why/when") and a **service layer** centralizes reusable operational mechanics (the "how").

Use it when:

- Multiple workflows duplicate the same operational logic
- You're deciding what belongs in actions vs. shared services
- A bug fix in one flow doesn't propagate to others doing the same thing
- Adding a feature that shares mechanics with existing ones

Includes a migration checklist for extracting shared logic safely and a table of anti-patterns to avoid (god services, leaky services, over-abstraction).

### [evidence-driven-testing](evidence-driven-testing/SKILL.md)

Records visual proof while testing UI behavior. The agent drives the app live via computer use (or [cua-driver](https://github.com/trycua/cua) when the harness has no computer-use tools) while the bundled recorder captures the session, then posts the video and a results summary to the PR and tracker issue. The recorder (`scripts/evidence.py`, Python 3 + FFmpeg) runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows and has `doctor`, `start`, `annotate`, and `stop` commands. It timestamps each annotation as the agent tests, burns them into `evidence.mp4` on stop, and summarizes them in a generated `report.md` and `manifest.json`. Headless environments swap the recorder for scripted screenshots and Playwright captures; non-UI changes still get evidence (measured numbers, output pairs, transcript excerpts).

Use it whenever a change needs verifiable evidence that it works, instead of prose claims.

> The recorder needs `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` built with `libx264` and the `ass` filter, plus a screen-capture source: X11 (`DISPLAY`) or wlroots Wayland (`wf-recorder`; GNOME/KDE are not supported) on Linux, Screen Recording permission on macOS, any standard ffmpeg on Windows. `python3 scripts/evidence.py doctor` reports both. The raw capture is MPEG-TS, so a crashed or hard-killed recorder still yields usable evidence. The headless path needs only a running app and a scriptable browser (Playwright via npx). Posting evidence requires the `gh` CLI (or equivalent). `tests/test_evidence.py` smoke-tests the recorder end to end with a synthetic video source (`python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`).

### [greploop](greploop/SKILL.md)

Iteratively fixes a PR (GitHub), MR (GitLab), or shelved changelist (Perforce) until Greptile gives a perfect review: 5/5 confidence with zero unresolved comments. Triggers the review, fixes actionable comments, resolves threads, pushes, and repeats, up to `--max-iterations` cycles (default 10).

Use it to get a PR to a clean Greptile review before merge.

> Vendored from [greptileai/skills](https://github.com/greptileai/skills) (MIT, license included in the folder). Requires Greptile installed on the repo and an authenticated `gh`/`glab`/`p4` CLI.

### [greploop-apps](greploop-apps/SKILL.md)

The same loop as greploop, but it triggers reviews by tagging `@greptile-apps`, which bypasses Greptile's file-count limit on huge PRs that the plain `@greptile` mention refuses to review. When no check run appears, it falls back to polling Greptile's edited summary comment.

Use it when greploop's trigger gets "Too many files changed for review".

> Local variant derived from greptileai's greploop (MIT, license included in the folder); no separate upstream.

### [new-feature](new-feature/SKILL.md)

Starts every new task in an isolated Git worktree branched from `origin/main` so multiple agents can work on the same repo in parallel without conflicts. It covers unique task naming, a scope check against open PRs, fresh dependency installs, and cleanup after merge.

Use it when:

- Starting any new feature, fix, or task, before writing code
- Multiple agents (or sessions) work the same repository concurrently
- You need a consistent branch-per-task convention with safe cleanup

Includes harness deltas for Claude Code and Cursor, which manage worktrees themselves.

### [unslop](unslop/SKILL.md)

Edits prose to remove AI tells and put a human voice back in. It names 31 patterns to catch (puffery, filler, hedging, chatbot phrases, em dashes, colons as connectors, bold and emoji overuse, abstract metaphor nouns, passive voice) and a short checklist for adding opinion and rhythm, applied as a four-step loop: scan, rewrite, add soul, self-audit.

Use it when:

- Writing anything a person will read: commit messages, PR titles and bodies, docs, README edits, code comments, chat replies
- Cleaning up existing text that reads machine-made

> Vendored from [cursor/plugins (pstack)](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/skills/unslop) (MIT, license included in the folder). The body matches upstream; the frontmatter has two edits so agents apply the skill on their own instead of waiting for a typed `/unslop`. We dropped the `disable-model-invocation: true` line, and the description now names the trigger (text you write or edit for a human reader) in place of upstream's "any writing. Must always apply.", so auto-invocation matches the scope `AGENTS.md` gives it. Restore the flag if you want slash-command-only behavior.

## Workflow

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) ties the skills together into a four-beat workflow: isolate (`new-feature`) → build (`code-structure`) → prove (`evidence-driven-testing`) → ship (`before-and-after` + `greploop`), with `unslop` applied to everything written for humans along the way. Drop it into a repo alongside the skills and fill in the repo-specific callouts (checks, invariants, environment).

## Installation

Use `npx skills` to install skills to most coding agents:

```bash
npx skills add sema-solutions/Software-factory-skills
```

Claude Code picks up the skill automatically and invokes it when a task matches the skill's description. You can also invoke one explicitly with `/code-structure` or `/evidence-driven-testing`.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create a folder named after the skill (kebab-case).
2. Add a `SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter. The description is what Claude uses to decide when the skill applies, so make it trigger-focused ("Use when...").
3. Keep instructions concise and actionable; link out to reference files in the folder if they get long.
