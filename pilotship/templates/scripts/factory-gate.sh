# factory-template-version: 1.1  (keep: factory-init.sh compares it on re-runs)
# factory-gate.sh — the software factory's entry gate, wired into the agent
# harness as hooks (see .claude/settings.json). Two modes:
#
#   session    SessionStart hook. Prints the "start here" checklist and the
#              current isolation status so every fresh session, in every
#              harness that supports a start hook, sees the contract before
#              it does anything, even a session opened on a stale checkout.
#
#   pre-tool   PreToolUse hook for file edits and shell commands. Reads the
#              tool call as JSON on stdin and refuses (exit 2) anything that
#              would write to the PRIMARY checkout while it sits on the
#              default branch. Work belongs in a worktree on a task branch;
#              that is beat 1.
#
# What pre-tool refuses, and from where:
#   - Edit / Write / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit whose target resolves inside
#     the primary checkout (and not inside a worktree directory), from ANY
#     session location. A session inside a worktree cannot reach over.
#   - Bash commands while the session's cwd is the primary checkout on the
#     default branch: mutating git subcommands (commit, merge, rebase,
#     cherry-pick, revert, reset, am, apply, stash pop/apply) in any segment
#     of the command, shell redirects into repo paths, and the usual
#     in-place writers (sed -i, tee, cp, mv, rm, touch, patch, ln, mkdir)
#     aimed at repo paths. Redirects to /dev/null, /tmp, .artifacts and
#     paths outside the repo pass.
#   - Bash commands from any session that point git at the primary checkout
#     (`git -C <primary> commit`, `cd <primary> && git commit`).
#   The Bash side is a tripwire for the common forms, not a sandbox; the
#   Edit/Write hook and the harness's own permission rules are the guards.
#
# Escape hatch for a human doing emergency work by hand: FACTORY_GATE=off in
# the environment skips the block (the checklist still prints). Agents must
# never set it.

  2. Fresh session: you are reading the current AGENTS.md now. A session that
     started before it changed does not know the contract; do not carry one over.
  3. Every task begins with the new-feature skill: a worktree and branch off
     origin/main, then `bash scripts/worktree-env.sh` inside it. Never on main.
  4. Build, prove with evidence, open the PR from the template, then greploop
     until the reviewer reports 5/5 with zero unresolved comments.
  5. A human merges. Never below 5/5, never with an open thread.
